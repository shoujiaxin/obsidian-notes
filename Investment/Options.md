## Elementary Definitions

Four specifications uniquely describe any option contract:

- the type (`put` or `sell`)
- the underlying stock name (the underlying security)
- the expiration date
- the striking price

Relationship of the option price and stock price:

- In-the-Money
- Out-of-the-Money

**Intrinsic value**:

|                  |             Call             |             Put              |
| ---------------- | :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: |
| In-the-money     | Stock price > Striking price | Stock price < Striking price |
| Out-of-the-money | Stork price < Striking price | Stock price > Striking price |

The value is 0 if the option is out-of-the-money

$\text{Call time value premium} = \text{Call option price} + \text{Striking price} - \text{Stock price}$
